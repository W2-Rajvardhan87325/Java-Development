## Project Overview
This project is part of the Preparatory Assignment provided by Sunbeam. It includes 15 C language questions that have been solved and converted into a Java-based solution. This project demonstrates core Java concepts like classes, methods, loops, arrays, and control structures.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/W2-Rajvardhan87325/Java-Development.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build the project to resolve any dependencies.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains all the Java source code files.
- **com.app**: The main package containing classes for the assignment.
  - `ClassName.java`: Description of what this class does.
  
Each class corresponds to the solution for each problem from the C preparatory assignment.

## Usage
1. Run the main class from the IDE or using the command line:
   ```bash
   java com.app.MainClass
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to test each functionality.

The project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts such as:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Arrays and loops for control flow.
- Basic data structure manipulation.

## Conclusion
This Java project showcases the solutions to preparatory assignment problems by applying Java programming techniques. It's a foundational project to build upon Java skills for more complex applications.
